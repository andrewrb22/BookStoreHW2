# Book Store HW2
## The goal of this coding exercise is to create two classes BookstoreBook and LibraryBook. Both classes have these attributes: 
### author: String 
### tiltle:  String 
### isbn : String  
 
#### - The BookstoreBook has an additional data member to store the price of the book, and whether the book is on sale or not. If a bookstore book is on sale, we need to add the reduction percentage (like 20% off...etc). For a LibraryBook, we add the call number (that tells you where the book is in the library) as a string. The call number is automatically generated by the following procedure: 
 
 ### The call number is a string with the format xx.yyy.c, where xx is the floor number that is randomly assigned (our library has 99 floors), yyy are the first three letters of the authorâ€™s name (we assume that all names are at least three letters long), and c is the last character of the isbn.  
 
### - In each of the classes, add the setters, the getters, at least three constructors (of your choosing) and override the toString method (see sample run below). Also, add a static variable is each of the classes to keep track of the number of books objects being created in your program. 
 
### - Your code should handle up to 100 bookstore books and up to 200 library books. Use arrays to store your objects. 
 
### - Your code should display the list of all books keyed in by the user
